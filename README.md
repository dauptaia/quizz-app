# quizz-app


This little quizz App is a ligh MCQ form customized to my needs.
- The MCQ series are defined using a YAML file.
- A web app renders the quizz, adding confidence level for each question.
- Answers are stored as a CSV file, alongside the correct answer and the confidence level.

As a result the submissions can be used to build the Brier score or participants.

I hope this project does not becomes too much time consuming.

## To test locally

Local test are done using:

```bash
flask run
```


## Disclaimer

I am not a web developer. I developed this through careful top-down prompt engineering , using the free GPT portal (GPT5).
